\section{Introduction}

While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular
processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression 
changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce 
\emph{CARNIVAL}~\cite{CARNIVAL}, a causal network contextualization tool which 
derives network architectures from gene expression footprints. \emph{CARNIVAL} 
(CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue 
programming)(see \url{https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/}) integrates different
sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed proteinâ€“protein 
interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures.

\subsection{CARNIVAL pipeline}

CARNIVAL refines a quantitative objective function for ILP problem by 
incorporating TF and pathway activities on a continuous scale. In addition, the 
CARNIVAL framework allows us to contextualize the network with or without known 
targets of perturbations. The implementation is separated into two pipelines 
which will be referred henceforth as Standard CARNIVAL \emph{StdCARNIVAL} (with 
known perturbation targets as an input) and Inverse CARNIVAL \emph{InvCARNIVAL} 
(without information on targets of perturbation), see Figure 
\ref{fig:carnival_pipeline}. The differential gene expression is used to infer 
transcription factor (TF) activities with DoRothEA, which are subsequently 
discretized in order to formulate ILPconstraints. As a result, CARNIVAL derives 
a family of highest scoring networks which best explain theinferred TF 
activities. Continuous pathway and TF activities can be additionally considered
in the objective function.

\end{center}

\subsection{ILP solvers}
\emph{CARNIVAL} is an extension of the previously implemented Causal Reasoning 
method from Melas et al.~\cite{Melas}.The network inference process is swiftly 
performed with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of causal 
reasoning using three solvers: the \emph{R-CRAN lpSolve} free software used for
solving linear problems; the open-source mixed integer programming solver
\emph{Cbc} (Coin-or branch and cut)(see \url{https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc}); 
or the \emph{CPLEX optimizer} from \emph{IBM} (see 
\url{https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer}) which can be obtained for 
free through the Academic Initiative. To perform the analysis with \emph{cplex}
or \emph{cbc}, the users will then need to store the binary \emph{cbc} or
\emph{cplex} executables on any  directory they wish. The binary files of
\emph{cbc} can be found by first downloading one of the optimization suites
provided here: \url{https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OptimizationSuite/},
unzip the download and from there save the \emph{cbc} executable (which can be
found on the \emph{bin} directory) file on any of the direcotries they wish of
their machines. As for the \emph{cplex}, the executable file can be obtained
after registration on the \emph{ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio} here:
\url{https://my15.digitalexperience.ibm.com/b73a5759-c6a6-4033-ab6b-d9d4f9a6d65b/dxsites/151914d1-03d2-48fe-97d9-d21166848e65/technology/data-science}. 
Similar like before, users will have to find the \emph{cplex} executable binary 
file and save on a directory of their own wish or keep them on their default 
installation paths. The path to interactive version of \emph{CPLEX} is differed 
based on the operating system. The default installation path for each OS is as 
follows:

For Mac OS:
<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# ~/Applications/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x86-64_osx/cplex
@

For Linux:
<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# /opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/cplex
@

For Windows:
<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# C:/Program Files/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x64_win64/cplex.exe
@

Note that the version of \emph{CPLEX} has to be changed accordingly (the latest
current version is CPLEX-Studio129).

The  \emph{lpSolve} solver can be used after downloading and installing the
\emph{lpSolve} R-package (see
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lpSolve/index.html}). This solver
only works for smaller examples and it can give only one optimal solution. For
larger real-case examples, the users can use \emph{cbc} or \emph{cplex} solvers.

While \emph{Cbc} is open-source and can be used from any user, the \emph{CPLEX}
solver is more computationally efficient and is able to provide multiple
equivalent solutions which are then combined. The  \emph{mipGAP},
\emph{limitPop}, \emph{poolCap}, \emph{poolIntensity} and \emph{poolReplace}
work only if \emph{CPLEX} solver is used to train the networks.

\section{Running CARNIVAL}

In the CARNIVAL package, built-in examples are available as the test cases as 
follows:

1. A small toy example where the inputs are known (\emph{stdCARNIVAL})

2. A small toy example where the inputs are not known (\emph{invCARNVAL})

\subsection{Toy Example - 1}

Let us consider the toy example of \ref{fig:toy_network_ex1}. In this case, the
inputs are known (\emph{I1=1} and \emph{I2=1}), while the network has all the
interactions as activatory besides the connection connecting \emph{I2} with
\emph{N2}. The measurements we have them both \emph{M1=1} and \emph{M2=1}.

Users can run the CARNIVAL analysis with the free solver as follows:

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(CARNIVAL)

load(file = system.file("toy_inputs_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_measurements_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_network_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))

# lpSolve
result = runCARNIVAL(inputObj = toy_inputs_ex1, measObj = toy_measurements_ex1,
                     netObj = toy_network_ex1)

print(result)
@

The \emph{result} object will contain the following fields:

- \emph{weightedSIF}: which contains all the combined solutions generated
(\emph{lpSolve} and \emph{cbc} will generate only 1 solution, while \emph{cplex}
can generate multiple solutions) with the Weight column indicating how
frequently an interaction has appeard on the combined solution.

- \emph{nodesAttributes}: indicating the weigted mean activities of each of the
proteins present in the combined solution and the type of the node (Input (S),
Measured (T) or Inferred).

- \emph{sifAll}: A list containing all the separate CARNIVAL solutions.

The CARNIVAL results for the Toy Example - 1 are as shown in
\ref{fig:toy_network_ex1_solution}.

\caption{Solution network of Toy Example - 1}
\label{fig:toy_network_ex1_solution}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Toy Example - 2}

Now let us consider the toy example of \ref{fig:toy_network_ex2}. In this case,
the inputs are not known and thus a dummy \emph{Perturbation} node will be
automatically generated and which connects all the nodes in the network which
do not have any incoming interaction via activatory and inhibitory interactions.
In this way, CARNIVAL will infere the possible activities of the upper nodes in
a way which best fits the downstram measurements

Users on this case can run the invCARNIVAL analysis with the free solver as
follows:

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(CARNIVAL) # load CARNIVAL library

load(file = system.file("toy_measurements_ex2.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_network_ex2.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))

# lpSolve
result = runCARNIVAL(measObj = toy_measurements_ex2, netObj = toy_network_ex2)

print(result)
@

The CARNIVAL results for the Toy Example - 2 are as shown in
\ref{fig:toy_network_ex2_solution}.

\label{fig:toy_network_ex2_solution}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Real Case Example}
Now we show an example about how we can run CARNIVAL on a real case-study. We 
will show step-by-step how we can build a prior knowledge of signalling and a 
DoRothEA regulon list from ~\emph{OmniPath}~\cite{OmniPath} (see 
\url{https://github.com/saezlab/OmnipathR} for the R-package). Next we show how
we can esti mate pathway activities via PROGENy (see 
\url{https://github.com/saezlab/progeny} for the R-package). Next we will 
demonstrate how we can use the \emph{viper}~\cite{viper} (see 
\url{https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/viper.html} for the
R-package). Finally we will show how we can use CARNIVAL to combine all this 
information in order to infer the causal regulatory network.

Through \emph{OmnipathR} package, we build the network object needed for 
contextualizing the signalling network with CARNIVAL.

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(OmnipathR) # load OmnipathR library

##importing interactions from SignaLink3, PhosphoSite and Signor
interactions <- 
  import_Omnipath_Interactions(filter_databases=c("SignaLink3","PhosphoSite", 
                                                  "Signor"))

## keeping the directed interactions
interactions <- interactions[which(interactions$is_directed==1), ]

# keeping signed interactions only
interactions <- 
  interactions[which((interactions$is_stimulation+
                        interactions$is_inhibition)==1), ]

## now building the network data-frame and keeping it as netObj
network <- matrix(data = , nrow = nrow(interactions), ncol = 3)
network[, 1] <- interactions$source_genesymbol
network[which(interactions$is_stimulation==1), 2] <- "1"
network[which(interactions$is_inhibition==1), 2] <- "-1"
network[, 3] <- interactions$target_genesymbol

netObj <- as.data.frame(network)
@

For the analysis we consider the expression data example from the \emph{progeny} 
R-package (see \url{https://github.com/saezlab/progeny}). We estimate normalized
(from -1 to 1) pathway activity scores via the \emph{progeny} function for the 
first sample and then we assign the inferred activities as node weights to the 
progeny members from the \emph{progenyMembers} object loaded from 
\emph{CARNIVAL} package. Users can estimate the pathway activities for any 
sample they wish (see documentation of \emph{assignPROGENyScores()} function)

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(progeny)
library(CARNIVAL)

expr <- as.matrix(read.csv(system.file("extdata", "human_input.csv", 
                                              package = "progeny"), 
                                              row.names = 1))

human_def_act <- progeny(expr, scale = TRUE,  organism = "Human", top = 100, 
                         perm = 10000, z_scores = FALSE)


## loading the progeny members to assign the weights
load(file = system.file("progenyMembers.RData",package="CARNIVAL"))

## now assigning the PROGENy weights to pathway members only for the first 
## sample which we can consider for the CARNIVAL analysis
weightObj <- assignPROGENyScores(progeny = human_def_act, 
                                 progenyMembers = progenyMembers, 
                                 id = "gene", access_idx = 1)
@

Next we can retrieve regulons from OmniPath and create the regulon table. From
there we obtain the \emph{viper} regulon list through the 
\emph{createRegulonList} function (see documentation for more details).

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
regulon_df <- 
  import_TFregulons_Interactions(select_organism = 9606)

regulon_df <- 
  regulon_df[which((regulon_df$is_stimulation+regulon_df$is_inhibition)==1), ]

regulon_table <- matrix(data = , nrow = nrow(regulon_df), ncol = 3)
regulon_table[, 1] <- regulon_df$source_genesymbol
regulon_table[which(regulon_df$is_stimulation==1), 2] = "1"
regulon_table[which(regulon_df$is_inhibition==1), 2] = "-1"
regulon_table[, 3] <- regulon_df$target_genesymbol

regulons <- createRegulonList(regulon_table = regulon_table)
@

From here we can estimate the TF activities and generate the continuos 
measurement inputs for CARNIVAL.

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(viper)

TF_activities = as.data.frame(viper::viper(eset = expr, 
                                           regulon = regulons, nes = T, 
                                           method = 'none', minsize = 4, 
                                           eset.filter = F))

tfList <- generateTFList(df = TF_activities, top = "all", access_idx = 1)
@

So far we have generated the prior knowledge network which will be used to 
contextualize the regulatory signalling network (\emph{netObj}) as well as a 
list object containing the progeny weights (\emph{weightObj}) and the TF 
activities (\emph{tfList} to be assigned to the \emph{measObj}). For running 
CARNIVAL we have to access one element at the time from the \emph{weightObj} and
\emph{tfList}. We use all this as inputs to run the CARNIVAL analysis through 
the \emph{runCARNIVAL} function. Since the input targets are not known, we 
perform the \emph{invCARNIVAL} analysis.

<<eval=FALSE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=

##users need to define the path to the cplex solver

res <- runCARNIVAL(measObj = tfList[[1]], netObj = netObj, 
                   weightObj = weightObj[[1]], solverPath = solverPath, 
                   solver = "cplex", DOTfig = TRUE)

@

The solution network of this small real-case application is as shown in 
\ref{fig:real_case}.
