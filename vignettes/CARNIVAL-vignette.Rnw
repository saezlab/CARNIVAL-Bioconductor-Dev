\section{Introduction}

While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular
processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression 
changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce 
\emph{CARNIVAL}~\cite{CARNIVAL}, a causal network contextualization tool which 
derives network architectures from gene expression footprints. \emph{CARNIVAL} 
(CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue 
programming)(see \url{https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/}) integrates different
sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed proteinâ€“protein 
interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures.

\subsection{CARNIVAL pipeline}

CARNIVAL refines a quantitative objective function for ILP problem by 
incorporating TF and pathway activities on a continuous scale. In addition, the 
CARNIVAL framework allows us to contextualize the network with or without known 
targets of perturbations. The implementation is separated into two pipelines 
which will be referred henceforth as Standard CARNIVAL \emph{StdCARNIVAL} (with 
known perturbation targets as an input) and Inverse CARNIVAL \emph{InvCARNIVAL} 
(without information on targets of perturbation), see Figure 
\ref{fig:carnival_pipeline}. The differential gene expression is used to infer 
transcription factor (TF) activities with DoRothEA, which are subsequently 
discretized in order to formulate ILPconstraints. As a result, CARNIVAL derives 
a family of highest scoring networks which best explain theinferred TF 
activities. Continuous pathway and TF activities can be additionally considered
in the objective function.

\subsection{ILP solvers}
\emph{CARNIVAL} is an extension of the previously implemented Causal Reasoning 
method from Melas et al.~\cite{Melas}.The network inference process is swiftly 
performed with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of causal 
reasoning using three solvers: the \emph{R-CRAN lpSolve} free software used for
solving linear problems; the open-source mixed integer programming solver 
\emph{Cbc} (Coin-or branch and cut)(see \url{https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc}); 
or the \emph{CPLEX optimizer} from \emph{IBM} (see 
\url{https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer}) which can be obtained for 
free through the Academic Initiative. To perform the analysis with \emph{cplex}
or \emph{cbc}, the users will then need to store the binary \emph{cbc} or 
\emph{cplex} executables on any  directory they wish. The binary files of 
\emph{cbc} can be found by first downloading one of the optimization suites 
provided here: \url{https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OptimizationSuite/}, 
unzip the download and from there save the \emph{cbc} executable (which can be 
found on the \emph{bin} directory) file on any of the direcotries they wish of 
their machines. As for the \emph{cplex}, the executable file can be obtained 
after registration on the \emph{ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio} here: 
\url{https://my15.digitalexperience.ibm.com/b73a5759-c6a6-4033-ab6b-d9d4f9a6d65b/dxsites/151914d1-03d2-48fe-97d9-d21166848e65/technology/data-science}. 
Similar like before, users will have to find the \emph{cplex} executable binary 
file and save on a directory of their own wish or keep them on their default 
installation paths. The path to interactive version of \emph{CPLEX} is differed 
based on the operating system. The default installation path for each OS is as 
follows:

For Mac OS:
<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# ~/Applications/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x86-64_osx/cplex
@

For Linux:
<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# /opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/cplex
@

For Windows:
<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# C:/Program Files/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x64_win64/cplex.exe
@

Note that the version of \emph{CPLEX} has to be changed accordingly (the latest 
current version is CPLEX-Studio129).

The  \emph{lpSolve} solver can be used after downloading and installing the
\emph{lpSolve} R-package (see 
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lpSolve/index.html}). This solver
only works for smaller examples and it can give only one optimal solution. For
larger real-case examples, the users can use \emph{cbc} or \emph{cplex} solvers.

While \emph{Cbc} is open-source and can be used from any user, the \emph{CPLEX} 
solver is more computationally efficient and is able to provide multiple 
equivalent solutions which are then combined. The  \emph{mipGAP}, 
\emph{limitPop}, \emph{poolCap}, \emph{poolIntensity} and \emph{poolReplace} 
make sense only if \emph{CPLEX} solver is used to train the networks.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
Besides the above mentioned solvers, users need also to install the following 
R-package dependencies: \emph{readr}(see 
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html}); \emph{igraph}
(see \url{https://igraph.org/r/}); \emph{readxl}(see 
\url{https://readxl.tidyverse.org/}); \emph{dplyr}(see 
\url{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8});
\emph{lpSolve}(see \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lpSolve/index.html})

In order to visualize the automatically generated \emph{CARNIVAL} networks, 
users will also need to download and install the Graph Visualization software 
\emph{graphviz}(see \url{https://www.graphviz.org/}).

\section{Running CARNIVAL}

In the CARNIVAL package, built-in examples are available as the test cases as 
follows:

1. A small toy example where the inputs are known (\emph{stdCARNIVAL})

2. A small toy example where the inputs are not known (\emph{invCARNVAL})

\subsection{Toy Example - 1}

Let us consider the toy example of \ref{fig:toy_network_ex1}. In this case, the
inputs are known (\emph{I1=1} and \emph{I2=1}), while the network has all the
interactions as activatory besides the connection connecting \emph{I2} with 
\emph{N2}. The measurements we have them both \emph{M1=1} and \emph{M2=1}.

Users can run the CARNIVAL analysis with the free solver as follows:

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(CARNIVAL) # load CARNIVAL library
library(dplyr) # load dplyr library
library(readr) # load readr library
library(igraph) # load igraph library
library(readxl) # load readxl library
library(lpSolve)

load(file = system.file("toy_inputs_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_measurements_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_network_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))

# lpSolve
result = runCARNIVAL(netObj = toy_network_ex1, measObj = toy_measurements_ex1, 
                     inputObj = toy_inputs_ex1)

print(result)
@

The \emph{result} object will contain the following fields:

- \emph{weightedSIF}: which contains all the combined solutions generated 
(\emph{lpSolve} and \emph{cbc} will generate only 1 solution, while \emph{cplex}
can generate multiple solutions) with the Weight column indicating how 
frequently an interaction has appeard on the combined solution.

- \emph{nodesAttributes}: indicating the weigted mean activities of each of the
proteins present in the combined solution and the type of the node (Input (S), 
Measured (T) or Inferred).

- \emph{sifAll}: A list containing all the separate CARNIVAL solutions.

The CARNIVAL results for the Toy Example - 1 are as shown in
\ref{fig:toy_network_ex1_solution}.

\label{fig:toy_network_ex1_solution}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Toy Example - 2}

Now let us consider the toy example of \ref{fig:toy_network_ex2}. In this case,
the inputs are not known and thus a dummy \emph{Perturbation} node will be 
automatically generated and which connects all the nodes in the network which 
do not have any incoming interaction via activatory and inhibitory interactions.
In this way, CARNIVAL will infere the possible activities of the upper nodes in
a way which best fits the downstram measurements

Users on this case can run the invCARNIVAL analysis with the free solver as
follows:

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(CARNIVAL) # load CARNIVAL library
library(dplyr) # load dplyr library
library(readr) # load readr library
library(igraph) # load igraph library
library(readxl) # load readxl library
library(lpSolve)

load(file = system.file("toy_measurements_ex2.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_network_ex2.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))

# lpSolve
result = runCARNIVAL(netObj = toy_network_ex2, measObj = toy_measurements_ex2)

print(result)
@

The CARNIVAL results for the Toy Example - 2 are as shown in
\ref{fig:toy_network_ex2_solution}.
