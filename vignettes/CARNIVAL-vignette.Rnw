\section{Introduction}

While gene expression profiling is commonly used to gain an overview of cellular
processes, the identification of upstream processes that drive expression 
changes remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce 
\emph{CARNIVAL}~\cite{CARNIVAL}, a causal network contextualization tool which 
derives network architectures from gene expression footprints. \emph{CARNIVAL} 
(CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue 
programming)(see \url{https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/}) integrates different
sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed proteinâ€“protein 
interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures.

\subsection{CARNIVAL pipeline}

CARNIVAL refines a quantitative objective function for ILP problem by 
incorporating TF and pathway activities on a continuous scale. In addition, the 
CARNIVAL framework allows us to contextualize the network with or without known 
targets of perturbations. The implementation is separated into two pipelines 
which will be referred henceforth as Standard CARNIVAL \emph{StdCARNIVAL} (with 
known perturbation targets as an input) and Inverse CARNIVAL \emph{InvCARNIVAL} 
(without information on targets of perturbation), see Figure 
\ref{fig:carnival_pipeline}. The differential gene expression is used to infer 
transcription factor (TF) activities with DoRothEA, which are subsequently 
discretized in order to formulate ILPconstraints. As a result, CARNIVAL derives 
a family of highest scoring networks which best explain theinferred TF 
activities. Continuous pathway and TF activities can be additionally considered
in the objective function.

\subsection{ILP solvers}
\emph{CARNIVAL} is an extension of the previously implemented Causal Reasoning 
method from Melas et al.~\cite{Melas}.The network inference process is swiftly 
performed with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation of causal 
reasoning using two solvers: the open-source mixed integer programming solver 
\emph{Cbc} (Coin-or branch and cut)(see \url{https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc}); 
or the \emph{CPLEX optimizer} from \emph{IBM} (see 
\url{https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer}) which can be obtained for 
free through the Academic Initiative. To perform the analysis, the users will 
then need to store the binary \emph{cbc} or \emph{cplex} executables on any 
directory they wish. The binary files of \emph{cbc} can be found by first 
downloading one of the optimization suites provided here: 
\url{https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/OptimizationSuite/}, unzip the 
download and from there save the \emph{cbc} executable (which can be found on 
the \emph{bin} directory) file on any of the direcotries they wish of their 
machines. As for the \emph{cplex}, the executable file can be obtained after 
registration on the \emph{ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio} here: 
\url{https://my15.digitalexperience.ibm.com/b73a5759-c6a6-4033-ab6b-d9d4f9a6d65b/dxsites/151914d1-03d2-48fe-97d9-d21166848e65/technology/data-science}. 
Similar like before, users will have to find the \emph{cplex} executable binary 
file and save on a directory of their own wish or keep them on their default 
installation paths. The path to interactive version of \emph{CPLEX} is differed 
based on the operating system. The default installation path for each OS is as 
follows:

For Mac OS:
<<eval=FALSE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# ~/Applications/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x86-64_osx/cplex
@

For Linux:
<<eval=FALSE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# /opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/cplex
@

For Windows:
<<eval=FALSE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# C:/Program Files/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/bin/x64_win64/cplex.exe
@

Note that the version of \emph{CPLEX} has to be changed accordingly (the latest version is CPLEX-Studio129).

\section{Getting Started}
A tutorial for preparing \emph{CARNIVAL} input files starting from 
differentially gene expression (DEG) and for running the \emph{CARNIVAL} 
pipeline are provided as vignettes in R-Markdown, R-script and HTML formats. The 
wrapper script \emph{runCARNIVAL} was introduced to take input arguments, 
pre-process input descriptions, run optimisation and export results as network 
figures. Three built-in \emph{CARNIVAL} examples are also supplied as case 
studies for users. Moreover processed gene expression values (besides 
differential values) can also be used as an input to \emph{CARNIVAL} but 
examples are not provided in this vignette.

\subsection{Prerequisites}
Besides the above mentioned solvers, users need also to install the following 
R-package dependencies: \emph{readr}(see 
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html}); \emph{igraph}
(see \url{https://igraph.org/r/}); \emph{readxl}(see 
\url{https://readxl.tidyverse.org/}); \emph{dplyr}(see 
\url{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8}).

In order to visualize the automatically generated \emph{CARNIVAL} networks, 
users will also need to download and install the Graph Visualization software 
\emph{graphviz}(see \url{https://www.graphviz.org/}).

\subsection{Installation}
\emph{CARNIVAL} is currently available for the installation as an R-package from our GitHub page.

<<eval=FALSE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# Install CARNIVAL from Github using devtools
# install.packages('devtools') # in case devtools hasn't been installed
library(devtools)
install_github('saezlab/CARNIVAL', build_vignettes = TRUE)
# or download the source file from GitHub and install from source
install.packages('path_to_extracted_CARNIVAL_directory', 
                 repos = NULL, type="source")
@

\subsection{Documentation}
After successfully installing \emph{CARNIVAL}, its documentation can be accessed as follows.

<<eval=FALSE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
# Open vignette as pdf file
vignette("CARNIVAL-vignette")

\subsection{CARNIVAL settings}
The main function of the \emph{CARNIVAL} package is \emph{runCARNIVAL}. This 
function runs the pipeline by using the user-provided list of inputs or run 
CARNIVAL built-in examples. These inputs are:

- \emph{solverPath}: Path to executable cbc/cplex file - default set to NULL, in
which case the solver from lpSolve package is used.

- \emph{netObj}: A matrix or data-frame object containing the prior knowledge 
networks as a list of directed and signed protein interactions. The first column 
should contain the source node, the second column should contain the sign of the 
interaction and the third column should contain the target node.

- \emph{measObj}:  A matrix or data-frame object containing the measurements 
(either gene expressions or estimated transcription factor activities).

- \emph{inputObj}: A matrix or data-frame object containing the experimental 
perturbation targets. The values can either be 1 (for activatory perturbations), 
-1 (for inhibitory effects of a perturbation) or NA (when we know that a protein 
is being targeted but we are not sure about the effect - in this case 
\emph{CARNIVAL} will try to infer the most likely effect). Default set to NULL 
(in this case we run \emph{InvCARNIVAL}).

- \emph{weightObj}: A matrix or data-frame object containing the pathway 
activity scores as inferred from \emph{runPROGENy}. Default set to NULL.

- \emph{solver}: Solver to use: \emph{lpSolve}, \emph{cplex} or \emph{cbc} 
(Default set to \emph{lpSolve}).

- \emph{DOTfig}: For plotting: define if DOT figure will be exported in the 
result folder (logical T/F). Default set to FALSE

- \emph{timelimit}: Optimization parameter: Time limit of optimisation (in 
seconds)

- \emph{mipGAP}: CPLEX parameter: Allowed gap of accepted solution comparing to 
the best solution (fraction; default: 0.05 = 5 percents).

- \emph{poolrelGAP}: Optimization parameter: Allowed relative gap of accepted 
solution comparing within the pool of accepted solution (fraction; Default set to 0.0001)

- \emph{limitPop}: CPLEX parameter: Allowed number of solutions to be generated 
(Default set to 500)

- \emph{poolCap}: CPLEX parameter: Allowed number of solution to be kept in the 
pool of solution (Default set to 100)

- \emph{poolIntensity}: CPLEX parameter: Intensity of solution searching 
(0,1,2,3,4 - Default set to 4)

- \emph{poolReplace}: CPLEX parameter: Replacement strategy of solutions in the 
pool (0,1,2 - Default set to 2 = most diversified solutions)

- \emph{alphaWeight}: Objective function: weight for mismatch penalty (Default 
set to 1 - will only be applied once measurement file only contains discrete 
values).

- \emph{betaWeight}: Objective function: weight for node penalty (Default set to
0.2)

- \emph{dir name}: Directory name where the users wishes to save the plotted 
network as a .DOT figure (in case if DOTfig=TRUE). By default it will be stored 
on a DOTfigure folder within the current working directory.

The  \emph{lpSolve} solver can be used after downloading and installing the
\emph{lpSolve} R-package (see 
\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lpSolve/index.html}). This solver
only works for smaller examples and it can give only one optimal solution. For
larger real-case examples, the users can use \emph{cbc} or \emph{cplex} solvers.

While \emph{Cbc} is open-source and can be used from any user, the \emph{CPLEX} 
solver is more computationally efficient and is able to provide multiple 
equivalent solutions which are then combined. The  \emph{mipGAP}, 
\emph{limitPop}, \emph{poolCap}, \emph{poolIntensity} and \emph{poolReplace} 
make sense only if \emph{CPLEX} solver is used to train the networks.

\section{Running CARNIVAL}

In the CARNIVAL package, built-in examples are available as the test cases as 
follows:

1. A small toy example where the inputs are known (stdCARNIVAL)

2. A small toy example where the inputs are not known (invCARNVAL)

\subsection{Toy Example - 1}

Let us consider the toy example of \ref{fig:toy_network_ex1}. In this case, the
inputs are known (\emph{I1=1} and \emph{I2=1}), while the network has all the
interactions as activatory besides the connection connecting \emph{I2} with 
\emph{N2}. The measurements we have them both \emph{M1=1} and \emph{M2=1}.

Users can run the CARNIVAL analysis with the free solver as follows:

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(CARNIVAL) # load CARNIVAL library
library(dplyr) # load dplyr library
library(readr) # load readr library
library(igraph) # load igraph library
library(readxl) # load readxl library
library(lpSolve)

load(file = system.file("toy_inputs_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_measurements_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_network_ex1.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))

# lpSolve
result = runCARNIVAL(netObj = toy_network_ex1, measObj = toy_measurements_ex1, 
                     inputObj = toy_inputs_ex1)

print(result)
@

The \emph{result} object will contain the following fields:

- \emph{weightedSIF}: which contains all the combined solutions generated 
(\emph{lpSolve} and \emph{cbc} will generate only 1 solution, while \emph{cplex}
can generate multiple solutions) with the Weight column indicating how 
frequently an interaction has appeard on the combined solution.

- \emph{nodesAttributes}: indicating the weigted mean activities of each of the
proteins present in the combined solution and the type of the node (Input (S), 
Measured (T) or Inferred).

- \emph{sifAll}: A list containing all the separate CARNIVAL solutions.

The CARNIVAL results for the Toy Example - 1 are as shown in
\ref{fig:toy_network_ex1_solution}.

\caption{Solution network of Toy Example - 1}
\label{fig:toy_network_ex1_solution}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Toy Example - 2}

Now let us consider the toy example of \ref{fig:toy_network_ex2}. In this case,
the inputs are not known and thus a dummy \emph{Perturbation} node will be 
automatically generated and which connects all the nodes in the network which 
do not have any incoming interaction via activatory and inhibitory interactions.
In this way, CARNIVAL will infere the possible activities of the upper nodes in
a way which best fits the downstram measurements

Users on this case can run the invCARNIVAL analysis with the free solver as
follows:

<<eval=TRUE, pgf=TRUE, echo=TRUE>>=
library(CARNIVAL) # load CARNIVAL library
library(dplyr) # load dplyr library
library(readr) # load readr library
library(igraph) # load igraph library
library(readxl) # load readxl library
library(lpSolve)

load(file = system.file("toy_measurements_ex2.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))
load(file = system.file("toy_network_ex2.RData",
                        package="CARNIVAL"))

# lpSolve
result = runCARNIVAL(netObj = toy_network_ex2, measObj = toy_measurements_ex2)

print(result)
@

The CARNIVAL results for the Toy Example - 2 are as shown in
\ref{fig:toy_network_ex2_solution}.
