#'\code{runCARNIVAL}
#'
#'Run CARNIVAL pipeline using to the user-provided list of inputs or run 
#'CARNIVAL built-in examples
#'Note: The pipeline requires either all required user-defined input variables 
#'(netObj and measObj) are set to NULL or CARNIVAL_example is set to NULL to 
#'execute
#'
#'@param solverPath Path to executable cbc/cplex file - default set to NULL, in
#'which case the solver from lpSolve package is used
#'@param netObj Data frame of the prior knowledge network - always required
#'@param measObj Data frame of the measurement file (i.e. DoRothEA normalised 
#'enrichment scores) - always required
#'@param inputObj Data frame of the list for target of perturbation - optional 
#'or default set to NULL to run invCARNIVAL when inputs are not known
#'@param weightObj Data frame of the additional weight (i.e. PROGENy pathway 
#'score or measured protein activities) - optional or default set as NULL to run
#'CARNIVAL without weights
#'@param solver Solver type that user wishes to use: lpSolve/cbc/cplex 
#'(default set to lpSolve). The lpSolve does not require installation of any 
#'solver and it can give only one solution and it is not optimal for modelling 
#'of very large networks. The free cbc solver can be used for modelling of large
#'scale networks and it can also give only one solution. The cplex solver is 
#'efficient, works well for lage scale networks and it can give multiple 
#'solutions.
#'@param DOTfig For plotting: define if DOT figure will be exported in the 
#'result folder (logical TRUE/FALSE - default set to FALSE)
#'@param timelimit CPLEX parameter: Time limit of CPLEX optimisation (in 
#'seconds - default set to 600)
#'@param mipGAP CPLEX parameter: Allowed gap of accepted solution comparing to 
#'the best solution (fraction; default: 0.05 = 5 percents)
#'@param poolrelGAP CPLEX parameter: Allowed relative gap of accepted solution 
#'comparing within the pool of accepted solution (fraction; default: 0.0001)
#'@param inverseCR Execute the inverse CARNIVAL pipeline (logical TRUE/FALSE)
#'@param DOTfig For plotting: define if DOT figure will be exported in the 
#'result folder (logical TRUE/FALSE)
#'@param timelimit CPLEX parameter: Time limit of CPLEX optimisation (in 
#'seconds)
#'@param mipGAP CPLEX parameter: Allowed gap of accepted solution comparing to 
#'the best solution (fraction; default: 0.05 = 5 percents)
#'@param poolrelGAP CPLEX parameter: Allowed relative gap of accepted solution 
#'comparing within the pool of accepted solution (fraction; default: 0.0001)
#'@param limitPop CPLEX parameter: Allowed number of solutions to be generated 
#'(default: 500)
#'@param poolCap CPLEX parameter: Allowed number of solution to be kept in the 
#'pool of solution (default: 100)
#'@param poolIntensity CPLEX parameter: Intensity of solution searching 
#'(0,1,2,3,4 - default: 4)
#'@param alphaWeight Objective function: weight for mismatch penalty (default: 
#'1 - will only be applied once measurement file only contains discrete values)
#'@param betaWeight Objective function: weight for node penalty (defaul: 0.2)
#'@param dir_name Name of the directory where to store the DOT figure (by 
#'default it will be stored in the /DOTfigures folder generated in the current 
#'working directory).
#'
#'@return The networks and predicted node activities from the CARNIVAL pipeline 
#'as a variable which are also saved in the destined result folder
